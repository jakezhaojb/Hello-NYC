Hello NYC!
=============

Introduction
------
I came to United States on August 18th, 2014. This is my first time reaching this amazing area. So I wrote a small program to record this impressive date.

Installation
------------
This program supports only Linux and Mac; For Windows users, I'm sorry!      
Try following commands in terminal to install it (e.g For Ubuntu users):
        make
        sudo make install
Hopefully, the program "nyc" will be installed in ENV path. Run it by:
        nyc
You will see beautiful fonts moving in the console! Hope you'll enjoy.
