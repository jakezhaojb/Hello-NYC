Hello NYC!
=============

Introduction
------
I came to United States on August 18th, 2014. This is my first time reaching this amazing area. So I wrote a small program to record this impressive date.

Installation
------------
This program supports only Linux and Mac; For Windows users, I'm sorry!      
Try following commands in terminal to install it (e.g For Ubuntu users):<br\ >
    make
    sudo make install
Hopefully, the program "nyc" will be installed in ENV path. Run it by:<br\ >
    nyc
You will see beautiful fonts moving in the console! Hope you'll enjoy.

Pre-requisite
----------------
Make sure you have successfully installed [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/) <br\ >
It is a tool for making beautiful fonts in terminal and very easy to install!
